Would gpt be the best to storyboard a children’s book, or which team member (ai engine/agent) would be best suited for this?
You said:
Not yet, but i am curious that now this is its own potential app for artists of all kinds to work through their products and get help in placing selling etc what is the net projections estimated in realism 
You said:
Approve drivers for inclusion, what is the new result
You said:
Seems like i would be handling high dollars for minimal return in comparison. Is there risk? What is the risk reward
You said:
Is it more profitable if i use it as an app for myself only and then let it be an addon service for stillhouse and heritageops
You said:
What does that new projection look like? And are there new drivers from this change that are worth considering for uplift
You said:
Yes, approve inclusion of new drivers
You said:
To be clear this is all new possible net without double dipping with the new outlook? And this is still set in realism?
You said:
What are some suggestions for naming this service that align with the brand and intent of the service
You said:
Maybe for now heritage press
You said:
Lock this and the scalability names for future reference when planning
