Just thinking, can these sheets be communicated via json?

Provide me a json version of these sheets data so i can give to gemini to add the necessary tasks to my google calendar to manage my deadlines until i have n8n up and running and can transition to more automated schedule control
You said:
Evaluate the potential affiliates and i am curious if i have enough that truly meet the built to last of the ethos
You said:
I am asking gpt to evaluate my current list with this criteria
You said:
Is there info missing from this master? I feel like i am starting over on this part
You said:
If i have keep transferring to new master threads due to weight, i need better connection until i can get everything set up
You said:
How do i address my current question more efficiently? Which thread retains the data i am after
You said:
If gpt can do that why not just give a json i can paste back into this master

Ok so now, review the list of potential affiliates to see if i have enough that truly meet the Heritage ethos based on reviews etc. i am wondering if i should move the launch of the shopper app to allow time to identify and align with enough affiliates that do or switch to focus on just my own line i can have confidence in later. If this is the route i need to know what the new focus would be? The wellness app? I can still build the infrastructure for the shopper app but that would be lower priority potentially
You said:
Not yet, i will like to focus on the wellness app. Was there a thought of the landing page and slogan etc for this approved yet?
You said:
That seems all the shopper app stuff not the wellness and as there is no gear to recommend that would need to be pushed to a later phase rollout
You said:
Seems like there is a lot more development needed on this than i realized
You said:
Lets make these the next bite sized and start with 1
You said:
What are some other name options that maybe tie in a bit more
You said:
Provide more like stillhouse, anchorline, the habor
You said:
Ignore van-pak going forward. It is no longer relevant 
You said:
For now lets use Stillhouse as the name. Is there an actual place or meaning to this?

Also, porchlight is cool and would like to use it for something else within the wellness app
You said:
Yes
You said:
I feel like the tagline and supporting line come across wrong, trying to be too clever again. Look to mark twain spoken by black bear brand 
You said:
D
You said:
Yes
You said:
This needs rewritten

Made for folks who build their own steady.
Designed to feel like a tool, not a task.
Built for those who still believe slow and steady wins something worth having.
You said:
It seems stuck in shopper app
You said:
Make this one match mark twain and black bear brand more

A quiet place to get your head right before the world starts talking again.

You said:
I feel like it got more silly
You said:
What about something in this vein

The world gets loud. Here you set the volume
You said:
Lock A save b for alternate
You said:
Yes
You said:
Oh 3 isnt done, i wanted to work on section 2
You said:
Did it change? This isnt what was above
You said:
Lets use the refined version but i want a different headline
You said:
Incorporate porchlight and a place to reflect and plan your next steps to build the life you want or enhance the one you already love
You said:
I think d for now
You said:
Is there a way to distill it further without losing meaning and keep to a shorter line
You said:
Ok, get rid of the constraint of having to incorporate porchlight and retry
You said:
Use this for reference

 a steady spot to look back, breathe deep, and plan the next good thing.

Maybe just use the second part

breathe deep, and plan the next good thing.
You said:
A
You said:
As a note, some of responses are getting to much again 
You said:
Bite sized 4
You said:
1 should use something already approved or new
2 is fine
3 the volume quote should be here
4 i feel like i already rejected this or something similar
5 is fine

You said:
1 is just reusing 5
You said:
What am i trying to get across in the promise block
You said:
Wasnt there something approved that fits that already
You said:
It seems to contradict this 

Tone: honest, human, calm — the opposite of “self-improvement” hype.
	•	Feeling: relief, belonging, trust — “this is for me.”
You said:
This but maybe a but tougher? I dont want people to feel wimpy

Nothing to chase—just space to breathe.

You said:
Yes, a for now
You said:
Yes
You said:
Yes
You said:
Looks good
You said:
Is there a lighter bite sized? How many remaining for the wellness app
You said:
Maybe just take a break and come back fresh.

How much more is need before working to develop the actual app? Is this something gpt can give me the code to bring to google ai studio and have a testable app
You said:
Do i need memberships to vite, react, firebase auth, firestore? 
You said:
Ok cool, and it would just tie to it through the code or do i need to have an account at least for wach
You said:
Perfect. Are there any agents that need setup prior to the app working or this can be independent tested and then agents would only support issues and later roll outs of features that require them
You said:
Not trying to add cost or complexity but just want to make sure i am not omitting something that would make the product better, more efficient, higher ROI etc. should i also be using perplexity as a core and agent roles
You said:
I mean with everything i am trying to do with these businesses
You said:
Yes, i think that would help and include hierarchy for each
You said:
Some of the agents dont list the ai running it
You said:
For the joint agents with two engines…would it make sense that those are two different roles with one engine each? Or is it 2 of the same role with a different engine solely running each
You said:
Can that be made more clear so i end up with an accurate agent count and understanding of the workflow 
You said:
The two engine/one role will be interesting to put together and watch run
You said:
Just add it in queue
You said:
Not to keep pulling a thread but why would it not end up being two separate agents and if one is handing the wrench to the mechanic then the first would be an assistant?
You said:
If it is a single agent with stages, will it be easy to tell where the issue is or will that obscure when troubleshooting
You said:
No that is fine, just wanted to walk through it so i could feel comfortable with the path forward
You said:
Check in
You said:
Check in means assessment
You said:
Am i doing anything they triggered watch point 1
You said:
Ok, just making sure i wasn’t doing anything already to warrant the warning
You said:
Ok, back to business. What do i still  need to do to see a draft workable stillhouse app
You said:
Yes do that. What is the estimated time it should take me to complete, view and test?
You said:
So like roughly 2 hrs if all goes well
You said:
Ok, i will stop working in this thread until i complete so i dont lose my place
You said:
Actually give me a json to take all the wellness app dev including the most recent breakdown to its own thread for focus and not interrupt additional ideation
You said:
Because of gemini low video limit , use Runway for heavy lifting on video renders.
You said:
How much is runway
You said:
But would runway be what helps create the life reels? Or what was the plan for that
You said:
So, if i have members of stillhouse creating videos, i would need which plan
You said:
Log this for a task
You said:
Bite sized or deep work as appropriate
You said:
Just put it in the list prioritized where it makes sense
You said:
Since i have been using gpt for a while, and sometime i feel like there is still a lot of ego boosting going on, i worry that it is maybe not being as realistic in its assessment of my ideas/plans as i mostly get glowing responses. would i get a different response if i put a custom note in the settings for being realistic and not overly accomodating


You said:
I have been doing that, but i am putting a lot into these business ideas and want to make sure i am working a legitimately viable plan that can realistically make the net profits being projected. I just worry that maybe gpt is being too accommodating in assessing me and my ideas
You said:
I feel like i have done a variation of all those in these different threads of conversation

 Let’s do that and add it as a periodic check point
You said:
I would like one now and will ad hoc request based on my gut feelings for now rather than a formal cadence at this time
You said:
All but give individual revenue stream assessments including net realism, and overall summary
You said:
What happened to the other revenue streams
You said:
I want to know the highest potential profit and net potential which i thought was the other revenue streams including licensing the agents, robot and car ai layers etc
You said:
Ok, so explain to me if i have asked for conservative forecasted dollars, consistently asked for realism, the numbers being shown now are many millions of dollars less than prior projections even after me calling that out
You said:
The prior projection was getting close to $10m not 1.5m that is a large variance. I’m trying to decide how much time and effort into this
You said:
But i thought building the agents was offsetting me not having a human team
You said:
I guess, i am wondering if i am still missing the better business idea that could make more net profit more efficiently instead of trying to run 15businesses to achieve my goals  
You said:
Yes let me see that
You said:
No i think i am fine with above. Instead of just audit, this is the realism i always want
You said:
Is there anything that can realistically make this into a million net by the end of 2026 without burning myself up
You said:
Do that, i will still get stillhouse done as i am using that as the learning ground and to get sorting out there and a small win to get momentum for these bigger efforts
You said:
No but it looks like the leroy heritage shopper app is no longer part of the plan at all?
You said:
Yes, but it would still still carry all the work i have approved so far? Or that is all irrelevant with this change 
You said:
Yes let me see that. 
You said:
Yes
You said:
Can this be made landscape and wrap text to avoid cutting off text or overlapping
You said:
1
You said:
Does this change any of the initial plans?
You said:
The company 1x is doing a few things that i should learn from and try to incorporate into my plan. Review them and see what can be incorporated except for building the robot https://www.1x.tech/neo
You said:
I meant this as a direct connection to my robot layers and person vr into robot business stream
You said:
Does this thread not have everything i already worked on regarding this venture?
You said:
Give me the json of all that information and i can start its own thread. But keep the new realism intact for the transfer
You said:
So current focus on leroy heritage and stillhouse is still the best, then agent licensing, then start working on robot layer?
You said:
Can gpt do some research to see if there is any other opportunity to increase roi for existing assets already being created and if one of the other AI would be better suited to run this scenario let me know
You said:
What does this do in terms of roi? Any compromises or downsides?
You said:
Where is my summary monetary impact result? 
You said:
Yes, and to be clear this is with the realism intact
You said:
Yes, include the year end 2026 totals summary area in the pdf
You said:
If i added any human labor would it help roi enough that it would make sense
You said:
Only for specialized support and technical contractor
You said:
If i have to hire for these roles, how do i make sure they dont just take a copy of what they build for me and reuse it
You said:
Not yet…how difficult will it be for me to do these things with the ai team here? Is the roi uplift worth the risk
You said:
Ok so no, but maybe keep in mind and have the setup done in a way that creates safe opportunity for future. Also, doing it myself for the first couple easier apps and agents will give me a decent idea of the process so i can avoid getting overcharged or oversold later
You said:
Yes, i want this to be a factor in all acct and systems setup that can allow for safe access when need to others that will minimize as much risk as possible especially once other peoples data or my accts are involved 
You said:
Great! Even though i dont actually have a product to show anything for what is being built i feel that there has been a lot of positive progress that is going to help make things flow smoother than they would have had i started building everything already a few months ago 
You said:
Sounds good
You said:
Great! Can i get a check in
You said:
My gut says this thread is heavy and we should do a json for master 5 but this time ensure that all the critical things that i had to brought back referenced, the realism mode etc. get carried over properly
