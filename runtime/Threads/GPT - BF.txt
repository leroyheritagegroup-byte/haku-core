Have this plan start saturday, i know it gets rid of two days but that is what i have
You said:
Are there any approvals and sign ups for anything such as affiliate etc can i get out there and working through at the same time as i am building stuff? Or do i have stuff built first. Want to make sure i am not waiting to get certain things moving in the background
You said:
So for my first 22hrs this weekend, my focus should be get basic site up, sign up and apply for affiliate programs, mailerlite, discord, google sheets,

Is the initial agent setup easy enough to also fit in this weekend or is that unrealistic
You said:
What name did i already agree to that i would use for the site/url
You said:
But if i am applying for affiliates wouldnt the site be for the clothing and wellness app?
You said:
I think there was a temporary logo that gpt made that i could use for the landing page. Can that be recalled? 
You said:
Go ahead and try, it had a blacksmith and looked like an old painted sign
You said:
I think this is ok for temp, but the other one was super cool, i just didnt get to save it before it was no longer available
You said:
Go ahead and try
You said:
This is much better
You said:
Yes
You said:
Can gpt adjust the image prior to have kind of a glowing amber color behind the blacksmith and kind of vignette to black at the edges
You said:
Right concept, but wrong photo. However, i like some of the layout changes. Can this one and the other be merged a bit. Use the layout of this version but the blacksmith and texture from the other one
You said:
No, this blacksmiths pose is wrong and i like the spark showing the hit, the other blacksmith looked older with a beard and an old hat
You said:
Yes
You said:
Brighten up the image of the blacksmith and the amber behind, the spark should be glowing orange and yellow
You said:
Can gpt fix the words at the bottom to be centered and add the texture back to the words. Leave everything else alone
You said:
going forward number or give the image an identifier so that it is easier to more specifically reference the proper one without trying to figure out how to describe it again
You said:
Provide me a good prompt for this image to see what gemini will provide

give me a task breakdown of these critical path items The Style Spine visual board must lock by Oct 30 or downstream content automation slips a week.
You said:
pdf checklist
You said:
Lets start with 2, give me the tone matrix that fits based on the percentage mix of the companies i provided for the photo/video recipes
You said:
Directly
You said:
Ok so is 2 complete?
You said:
Anything that gpt can do and let me weigh in/approve lets start working through the bite sized tasks. Also please utilize any prior completed tasks as reference to jump start
You said:
Yes
You said:
Can i get a pdf or image of what each looks like?
You said:
Go with b for now and can be reevaluated later
You said:
Is there a way for gpt to give some code that makes the squarespace site match?
You said:
Give a json for all this squarespace that i can to a thread for heritage theme
You said:
Ok what is next that i can review and approve
You said:
Can i see a sample of any of this
You said:
1
You said:
I feel like that is a good start and placeholder
You said:
Yes
You said:
Approved for now
You said:
Yes
You said:
I think these come across a bit cheesy, lets go for more of a cowboy or motorcycle rider would say it
You said:
Maybe add some black bear brand vibe in there
You said:
Yes, approved now. Let this drive the tone of the verbiage going forward
You said:
If i have been as consistent in my decision making and instructions, gpt should be able to use all those preferences in order to get closer to approved deliverables for tasks?

Yes

Responses seem too long and i am bringing this from another thread, and knew what is bright over. I only need a confirmation it was successful. Then i can ask follow up or continue on to the next task
You said:
How is the health of this thread? Is it heavy and i should transfer?
You said:
Provide a json, add a 2 at the end of the current thread name for this transfer
You said:
Are there any bite sized tasks i can review and approve easily on my phone
You said:
1b i like the first sentence but would like other options for the second 
You said:
Something more along “its in the details.” 
You said:
I think 1
You said:
Yes
You said:
I would like something that invites others in, not make them feel bad if the details dont matter to them. More of you should like this because it connects to a lineage of craft etc
You said:
4 for now
You said:
Yes
You said:
Affiliate
You said:
Explain what this is? Expansion?
You said:
I havent offered anything yet and will be just applying for affiliate, wouldnt this be initial? And then i would think i would need to know which ones i received approval back from?
You said:
I think i should apply to all that i approved prior to maximize chances of having enough approved to work with
You said:
I thought i approved a longer list than that
You said:
I think i need to review and see if there are more companies out there that are good quality/align to apply to
You said:
Lets break it up, even if there is overlap it will be clear what the focus is
You said:
Yes
You said:
Is any of the things i am doing catching me up to where i wont have to spend as much time tomorrow this weekend?
You said:
Maybe at the end of today so that i can have a clear picture of the day ahead
You said:
How many hours would i currently need to spend on sunday
You said:
How did i make up so much ground? I thought i was looking at 12-14hr days both days
You said:
So if i wanted i can afford to take tomorrow off and spend an 8hr day on sunday
You said:
I will still do some bite sized stuff through the day today to see if i can make sunday even lighter
You said:
Are there any more i can approve on my phone
You said:
For 1, what am i trying to get across? What is the purpose
You said:
What about more along the lines of “there are no options, just discipline. But that doesnt mean it has to be alone, do this together!” But rewrite so it fits 
You said:
I think A
You said:
Maybe change the first sentence to “discipline isnt optional”
You said:
Whatever is next i can do on my phone 
You said:
Who is the audience, the purpose
You said:
I think it should be called something more intuitive, i am not sure i see how it helps yet
You said:
I like “Field Notes” but would i have any issues using that with the actual company?

You said:
4 for now
You said:
Go ahead
You said:
I am not feeling any of them, again what is the message that I am trying to convey? I think d might be the closest but still not right
You said:
Which revenue stream
You said:
I personally would only see it useful for employees or investors
You said:
Since there isnt an investor and all employees will be agents there really isnt a need at this moment. But i am trying to see if there is a way of using the field notes as just a positive newsletter to subscribers of the shopper and wellness app
You said:
I would like something in there asking the subscribers for some kind of feedback engagement to social media or in email periodically “like whats your holiday plans” “what is the main meal you are looking forward to at your family gathering” “did you meet your goal? How can we help” etc 
You said:
Approved
You said:
Whats next
You said:
1c
You said:
Give me 4 other options
You said:
They are too long and dont feel like they go with the modified ones that just got approved
You said:
Built to last, meant to use
You said:
Yes
You said:
Give me a pdf of this sample
You said:
I think the sign off needs work
You said:
I think i want to do another version of the discipline isnt optional but you dont have to do it alone 
You said:
What about some form of let us help, can we join the journey, something that feels more community
You said:
4 for now
You said:
No thats fine, just try to incorporate these changes into the next suggestions 
You said:
Yes
You said:
1d, 2d, i dont like any of 3
You said:
None
You said:
What is the context? The ember is people that have just signed up for emails?
You said:
Well, i thought it was determined that we wont have any way to determine if they purchased or not until we move more to dropship and less affiliate only. 

It should just be encouraging,welcoming, and offering to help but not pushing a purchase
You said:
3 is closer but still not there
You said:
Lets go with 4 for now
You said:
How much time have i shave off sunday?
You said:
Yes
You said:
1-C, 2-D, 3-B, 4-B,
You said:
Yes
You said:
I thought i had a bunch more signing up and setting up agent work this weekend? Is that able to wait until the next week
You said:
Not yet, just making sure
You said:
Are there any other phone friendly tasks
You said:
What product(s) is 1 referencing
You said:
So why does it say “Leroy Heritage builds tools” we aren’t building anything for the shopper app, it is all affiliate and eventually dropship
You said:
Write one that sounds kind of like a match maker but still tough cowboy and black bear brand
You said:
1 is the best so far but still not there
You said:
Look at the stuff i have already approved and bring more in line, im tired so i am not able to out my finger in it but these just sound cheesy and not authentic
You said:
1 is the closest but still not there
You said:
I will have to try to write one as example when i am more awake as these seem to have gotten a little worse
You said:
Leroy Heritage helps you find gear built to be used, not displayed.”
You said:
Yes
You said:
Did that cut sunday down further
You said:
Yes
