What is the current list of agents that make heritageops
You said:
I thought there were a lot more agents? What about the troubleshooting agent
You said:
Yes
You said:
I don’t need a json as this is already the heritageops thread
You said:
I want the full list identified always, the can be tagged deferred or phased and in order of priority if more clear but also keep the AI engine stated
You said:
What training is needed, and how does this training get transferred once created in n8n etc
You said:
How much time is this effort and where does it fit in the overall schedule
