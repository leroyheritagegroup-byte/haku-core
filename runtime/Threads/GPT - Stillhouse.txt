What would the app landing page look like that would fit the name and still heritage brand 

Maybe an old but strong looking pastel yellow with white trim and black roof Stillhouse on a cool looking farm with a nice pathway a big oaktree with a tire swing and a porchlight on with a wraparound porch and porch swing and a red barn off in the distance cows and chickens in the fields and wild flowers everywhere at sunrise in georgia with a vintage film developed photo vibe and the the name Stillhouse written in a typography that fits the time of mark twain and then choices for activity selection
You said:
Is it too feminine? 
You said:
Can i see that alternate version
You said:
I like it
You said:
Just to keep pushing, what would a meet in the middle look like
You said:
Is it much different?
You said:
I will sit with it a bit
You said:
Can gpt actually make it move?
You said:
Not at the moment, but i have some questions regarding gemini
You said:
So it seems even with the ultra membership i have a pretty low limit for video generation. Is this going to be a problem with the reels?
You said:
I will have video needs for all streams
You said:
Dont forget the robots and cars
You said:
Gpt is understanding that i meant the revenue streams of robots and cars?
You said:
Oh, that is my fault, i thought i switch nack to the master. I will go over to that. Ignore robots and cars in this thread

Provide me a detailed hour by hour checklist of activities up to stillhouse app test
You said:
Did it grow in time from 2hrs to 15hrs due to the zero trust addition
You said:
Is there any way to flip it where i get to spend the original 2-4hrs to get a testable app and then spend the 13hrs doing the security?
You said:
Are there any lingering decisions bite sized or deep work pending for this build or is it all just getting into some deepwork dev build time
