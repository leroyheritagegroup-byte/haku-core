Approved but should this and the last approved item be one of the things that are options after the sale that the buyer can pay for ahead like the other 8 items i think that are currently flagged
You said:
How much of my time is currently sitting in the optional moats items?
You said:
Why would this not be in the master 10? What else is missing from master 10? This was supposed to be a complete full transfer no details missed not condensed
You said:
I thought for sure, i remember seeing hours for these
You said:
I’m talking about the other 8, i am pretty sure i saw hours
You said:
I even approved them to be in the tasks list just at the end so they dont get in the way of presale imperatives 
You said:
Why would i want the tasks and not the associated hours or value to be saved with it? How would that help me if i am trying to reevaluate something?
You said:
I want to know the current optional moat hours 
You said:
I already stated that i want the hours, so whatever that takes lets get the hours
You said:
Patch these so they are not lost
You said:
How much valuation and probability increase is sitting in the optional moat

Should this one be part of the presale? Also, what is cursor? Do i have to use that? If i have to use that are there other things that can be optimized by including it
You said:
I am good. Anything left ambiguous regarding this update needing my approval or clarification?
You said:
1a, 2a if roi is good enough, 3c, 4c, 5a
You said:
Generate Master10.2
You said:
Is cursor getting used more for anything presale with the new rule?
You said:
Is my presale on the best optimized path? I just started the tasks so it is still easily enough if i need to pivot at all
You said:
Why does it say my hours are ~52 per week? Am i reading that wrong

You said:
At least a lot of these ideas are increasing valuation. The post sale work is starting to add up
You said:
What is my minimum maximum saying?
You said:
That is not my saying and the rule in the rootstate. 

Minimalist something maximum valuation
You said:
Yes, so run analysis using this on everything in the moat.
You said:
Was there analysis on if these could be done a more minimalist way to achieve higher roi and more valuation?  Or was the analysis on the moat items as they are
You said:
Going forward MINIMALIST → MAXIMUM VALUATION ANALYSIS always means this
You said:
Hold on, not a “tiny version of” this is not the rule. It has to be minimized but still achieve full outcome
You said:
This is not just moat related, this is a rule for the business as a whole. I feel like i am repeating myself on this.
You said:
I feel like gpt still isnt getting it
You said:
Does this mean everything needs to be evaluated to ensure i am on the optimized path that achieves the proper outcome of proper results? 
You said:
Is this just a problem in understanding with this new master?
You said:
Can gpt run the analysis on current path and report suggested changes or confirmation that we are ok
You said:
B
You said:
B and then prioritize moat activities by roi
You said:
B
You said:
What do my current presale hours look like now after this?
You said:
This doesnt give me an answer. How many hours do i have presale total? Before i was sitting at about 50, where am i now?
You said:
Why is it show 26hours/week? Is that 26 hour per week to presale? Or 26hours total
You said:
Gpt still has not given me a clear answer to my question. What are my current total presale hours sitting at
You said:
I feel like gpt got messed up in the transfer. I was sitting at 520 total, then reduced hours to ~300, then 100, then 52 by delegating to agents and using a minimalist approach with maximum valuation and quality. 
You said:
What is going on? This is now way too many times since starting this new master thread. It is making me nervous
You said:
This has been from the start of this new thread, not after many more messages etc etc
You said:
This is just one piece though, what else is messed up? And the last time a consolidation happened it lost important details 
You said:
How do i know the correct “contradiction” is the one getting removed
You said:
I also want to make sure the minimalist approach with maximum value is understood, i still feel like it might be slightly off.

If a more simplistic, optimized route can be more easily delegated, performed, but still provide the full quality and intended result of the product or service that is the path to pursue 
You said:
This is not referring to quantity of demos, etc although that may be applicable too. I feel like gpt is stuck on the moat applications of this statement 

I am referring to the rule we had set in the prior thread that if a more simplistic toolset or tool/agent delegated pathway to the same result basically a form of work smarter not harder but with monetary implications   
You said:
Yes
You said:
Run the global optimization sweep
You said:
A - if i dont have to touch it to get the best outcome for what i am aiming for then i am not the bottleneck learning how to set something up or a new tool.
You said:
A - but if it is a structural change or naming, deleting etc i will still need to be made aware and approve those kind of changes
You said:
Just noticed RAO isn’t being referenced anywhere…
You said:
That is not the name
You said:
This is very concerning to me
You said:
How do i know nothing else major is missing? I feel like i have fully wasted my time in this thread with a corrupted master. Now i dont know what is missing from this one or even from the work i did here to the old master
You said:
This is just the latest example of of something missing, i just spent how long trying to get the proper meaning reinstated on a rule that was set, the hours being messed up
You said:
That is more excuses, this was an immediate result of missing after start
You said:
All i want is a json of the new moat items to bring to the old master to fix and move on from there. Do not include any information that has been corrupted
