Can i get a full list of the revenue streams being launch between now and the end of 2026
You said:
I think some of the revenue streams are separated but are the same?

 Is a sub event of Leroy Heritage
You said:
Is FinOps Derivative Products part of heritageops?

You said:
Where is the robot layers 
You said:
Going forward i want to have the Stream to only include the name of the stream and then add a column for sub stream that would detail out the other portion i am trying to see where they land
You said:
That is much better and super helpful
You said:
Ok, now that so many things have changed and reorganized. I would like an audit to see if there is any duplicative things, gaps, potential missed opportunities for increased revenue/roi
You said:
Assume all these suggestions approved and to be incorporated into the plan. How do these changes impact roi?

Also, i thought for Stillhouse, there was a few trier ideas discussed with more access to functions or at least expanded options, higher numbers of times to do the reels or items like that, also physical printouts of their journal to share or put on their bookshelves, etc
You said:
Are there any adjacent revenue streams with high roi that the work already being done would lend itself to without too much extra work that would align/fit tone and interest
You said:
How much extra time do these suggestions add
You said:
Oh i just realized the artsops or whatever it was being called is missing
You said:
No, the creative revenue stream for music,art,photo,video agents looking for leads placement opportunities editing etc 
You said:
As discussed, i dont care if it is paused, when i ask for the full list i need the full list. This also played into revenue opportunity with stillhouse
You said:
Also, i think the artops can be used for the healthcare for flyers, videos, writing etc
You said:
As a side note, i dont need the ego boost comments every time i ask a question. And i feel like even though the info being given is good i feel like it can be streamlined to give the same quality of information in many less words and less tables. This will help speed things up instead of me trying to read so much and then distill down the point(s) being made
You said:
I still want things formatted and easy to follow. Just if it can be put into one paragraph and contain the same information that gets to the point instead of 15, then that is what i want. I feel like i have already worked with gpt on this and it has been lost in the transfers. Make sure this and the notes above follow into the next thread. Also that everything should start with the summary or point of the material details coming up which should also be streamlined as much as possible
