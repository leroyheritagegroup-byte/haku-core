You said:
What is the percentage of likelihood of reaching these targets? Give me the likelihood percentage by state
You said:
Redo analysis for likelihood to assume all efforts were the same
You said:
What would it take to get georgia as high as utah? Or is this not realistic
You said:
If i were to focus on Georgia, what is the least amount of time per week i could input and still achieve the goal revenue. Assume ai agents involvement in tasks where applicable
You said:
Is the $235 assumed profit 
You said:
So it would take 6 months to get 35k net profit? With a sales cut of even on the high side 20% this does not seem like a good monetary path 
You said:
Yes
You said:
What other options does Van-Pak have to increase their ability for higher net profits especially in Utah
You said:
The dual asset strategy engines would be AI engines i would work to create?
You said:
What about a packaging equipment service troubleshooting technician assistant ai
You said:
Would gpt be able to put this tech troubleshooting assistant together with available information online or would this require a live tech input
You said:
So if i gathered data and prepped for inclusion with data indication of type, brand, model, she of machine at time of service where able, the symptom, the root cause(s), solution/fix
You said:
Ok, i would like to add a 4th pillar if possible, is there some option in the discussion that has not yet been identified as an opportunity
You said:
Ok, provide me a pitch of this package to to owner of van-pak including monetary splits, obligations, etc i want it to be fair, add potential profit projections regarding increase to van-paks normal operations as a separate amount and then any gain/profit from this. Also provide me my split same timeline with best ROI
You said:
Is the profit gains for utah and california only or does this require the other states to achieve as well 
You said:
Do that and then the other states can be added during evaluation periods as seen fit
You said:
What is the level of human time allocation per week to make this realistic and how much of my time would i need to input per week
You said:
Incorporate this into the van-pak pitch so that they can be aware of the time involved on their side but aware of the potential roi
You said:
Yes
You said:
Update to wrap text in appropriate cells to avoid cut off or jumbled text
You said:
Would this preclude me from being able to complete the heritageops?
You said:
But would i have to share profit/ownership if it is helping to further launch heritageops
You said:
Yes
You said:
Yes
You said:
I accidentally interrupted, proceed
You said:
If van-pak decides to get out after development has already started, what is my ability to recoup and continue
You said:
Yes, and add what happens if they decide to leave after deployment, as i won’t want to have to immediately buy them out
You said:
I think 30 days is too quick, what would be more realistic for me to pivot once made aware
You said:
Yes do the 60days
You said:
Since not all the service report were written in the manner spoken above with the details easily pulled i would like to create and agent for the purpose of interpretation and identify gaps in the info and suggest assumptions based on other data gathered 
You said:
Not yet but when i am ready
You said:
Is there any way to do this without van-pak and its data?
You said:
Yes
You said:
ROI based, where should this go in the heritageops focus
You said:
Yes
You said:
Yes
You said:
Wrap text, clear up overlap
You said:
What are the projections
You said:
This should now assume now van-pak involvement unless specified to do so
You said:
Provide projections
You said:
How does adding this additional revenue stream get me to my goal a year later?
You said:
I am referring to heritageops originally being able to achieve $200k goal early 2026 with a two program focus prior to adding SIGa. Do i need to bring notes from this thread to the other one to integrate and get a proper assessment? 
You said:
What would the best approach be to hit net profit target earlier and still be best setup for future growth
You said:
So what would SIGA do for the other streams? Are there any other optimizing choices that can be made to reduce level of effort and increase ROI
You said:
Are the any other agents to help optimize the flow and reduce rework when building the individual streams, 
You said:
How would these additions and changes implemented impact my  net profit target 
You said:
So it is realistic after only two months i can achieve $200k net? 
You said:
Yes and note that i want realistic feedback and need to be able to rely on the information i am receiving from gpt or else this is all for nothing
You said:
Not now, for later
You said:
Can i start building an agent to ideate now? How would i work with it and transfer the logic once i get the n8n going
You said:
Provide me a current list of all the identified agents that i need to build in order of priority. Also, would i apply the above to them as well?
You said:
I thought i had more agents identified in heritageops prior to this thread and had already started building training logic that i dont see on this list
You said:
Are any of these duplicative? Can this list be refined and tightened up for level of effort developing and ROI
You said:
Can the tech assistant be renamed to troubleshooting agent and also be used to troubleshoot the logic of everything being built for the revenue streams as troubleshooting methodology is still applicable and can be applied to anything and will help train and then can be given more nuanced applications such as the machines etc
You said:
Does this move it up in the priority list?
You said:
Yes
You said:
Pdf
You said:
Include
You said:
Text are jumbled in cells
You said:
I think A, there would not be enough room for all the columns to be properly displayed in portrait 
You said:
Looks great
You said:
Not yet, i would like a detail of my first 40hrs of time to invest based on priority
You said:
Yes, i need this in pdf
You said:
Can this thread be retitled now that it has been repurposed? 
You said:
Also, do i need any immediate accounts or memberships for the tasks in the first 40hours?
You said:
Provide in pdf
You said:
Did gpt get more system storage room for my account(not sure if i am using the right name for it)? The message at the top went away
You said:
Truth check: is gpt actually able to gauge the health or space remaining of the thread now? I remember asking and gpt said it was unable
You said:
Ok, this exaggerating seems to be creeping back into gpt interaction  
You said:
Yes, i worked hard to sharpen the responses and get rid of fluff or straight out lies, i dont want to have to keep reinvesting that duplicative time
You said:
Add realistic not over optimistic
You said:
Aim to have AACE and Lean sigma six as well as other business best practices wherever applicable
You said:
Is there anything that needs revised for the current plan to align
You said:
What agent can manage this? Can this be added to an existing or would a new agent be better?
You said:
I like the new name
You said:
Yes
You said:
What other best business practices can be analyzed an looked at for inclusion? What about Elon musk and his success
You said:
Yes
You said:
Both, that way i can see what works best for next time
You said:
Only things that can apply for successful implementation but within the timeframe i have available 
You said:
Confirmed
You said:
Yes
You said:
If the the percentages are real i will use those. 
You said:
Ok generate
You said:
This is taking too many confirmations
You said:
Yes
You said:
Generate it
You said:
Why is gpt disconnected? Also, if disconnected why offer or not disclose that earlier as an issue instead of delaying with confirm this and that
You said:
What is the eta for python to be up and running
You said:
Will this also be an issue for my businesses using gpt as the background for heritageops
You said:
Which agent(s) would perform the duties gpt is fulfilling right now?
You said:
Yes, and the plan to get them up and running immediately 
You said:
If gpt can generate now
You said:
I will wait, i want the pdf
You said:
Dont lie
You said:
The lie was that gpt would notify me when the generator is available
You said:
Is there an agent that handles efficiency of process flows? Also auditing to see if another agent can utilize something learned in a process with a different agent
You said:
I like adding it to this agent but i can wait for the revised copy
You said:
Before i start on the tasks, Is there anything in the plan i am neglecting?
You said:
Which agent will be able to evaluate me if i am potentially missing something and i can either choose to not include or utilize it
You said:
Yes
You said:
Can you provide me the best way step by step to learn what i need to know to setup the agents for my first 40hrs
You said:
Are any of the first set of agents grok powered?
You said:
Yes
You said:
Will there be any agent teams like a department if you will, with a grok and gpt working together?
You said:
Check in
You said:
Which agent would look at potential competition to make sure i am positioned well
You said:
Yes
You said:
Are there any products or companies that are directly competition for me
You said:
Packaging diagnostics is no longer part of my plan unless that specific niche is a realistic higher ROI over others
You said:
I would like to identify other areas markets to try to use the troubleshooting agent for…maybe to help asses other companies processes for problems?
You said:
Yes
You said:
What are the current revenue streams in order of priority setting up
You said:
Would it make sense to treat the current list of agents as the managers and create mini-agents for the sub activities /responsibilities so that we can create individual workflows for the mini-agents? Also, if this is the case which manager(s) would be in charge and reporting everything to me
You said:
So me, core command and m&O would represent the executive team
You said:
Does this change the first 40 hours tasks? Can we prioritze the managing agents and now the mini-agents accordingly
You said:
I think i need an executive assistant/admin agent to handle my action items, calendar, email, priority of what is on my plate etc
You said:
Yes
You said:
Will it be necessary for me to add any other human employees or will this be manageable with just me at a minimal input level and appropriate agent teams
You said:
Not yet
You said:
I think the first agent i should create is the EA Agent which will in turn help organize me to create the others. Please provide the details i need to complete this one agent setup including what i need for the other membership sign ups and set ups
You said:
Wouldn’t i need to create the n8n for the ea agent? How would this agent operate anything based here in a thread
You said:
How is spending the time manually adding the tasks in here better than creating the n8n? Just from a time investment and usefulness standpoint, ROI for time
You said:
Ok this makes sense now, just wanting to make sure i am always looking at the time ROI not just the money
You said:
Yes and then provide me the update information i need to copy and paste to the new EA agent thread
You said:
Provide me my current list of tasks to give to the EA agent
You said:
Please put it all in json so it will be easier to copy over. What is a fast way to request this list going forward
You said:
So the EA agent can truly access the thread i specify?
You said:
So then i ask again, should i create the n8n for this agent sooner than later
You said:
I will do the mini-n8n build so that the agent can directly access and adjust the information.
You said:
Yes, lets always use that route going forward unless otherwise requested
You said:
Yes
You said:
Once the agents are created with the n8n in place, what UI will I interact with them? How will i have “meetings” dialogue etc
You said:
What about discord? I just don’t have slack already
You said:
Yes
You said:
So i wont be able to just discord chat with the agent(s)?
You said:
After i set up an agent and n8n, how can i efficiently interact with the team
You said:
Yes, if different than above
You said:
Will i need a new json for discord and n8n based on the changes above?
You said:
All 5 and if possible, i will stick with N8N discord
You said:
In this thread gpt mentioned to communicate with each by the following @, /, and now ! So which is correct 
You said:
Would claude mcp be better than n8n?
You said:
I will need the agents going beyond my info to grab current market research etc and bring relevant data back
You said:
Build into the plan for all applicable agents to become mcp. 
You said:
What does this do to the timeline
You said:
Just provide me a new first 40hrs prioritized tasks breakdown to follow
You said:
I would like a json to bring into another thread that can be a clean step by step for my first 80hrs of tasks including getting membership, use this json for discord, use this json for agent __ and this json for workflow in n8n….
You said:
I didn’t see anything claude related? Is that after the first 80hrs? Maybe I missed it,  Is there a different program to implement mcp that i am already using?
You said:
But i thought above it was agreed that going straight to mcp for some agents while initially setting me back would increase roi exponentially. Why would that not be in the first 80hr set up
You said:
How is this thread? Does it seem like i may get close to mac and need a json to transfer to new master thread?
