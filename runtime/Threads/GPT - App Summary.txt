What about transition from affiliate plan
You said:
What are the Quiz questions
You said:
What is the current list for affiliates
You said:
Can gpt put these affiliates in a table
You said:
All in one table
You said:
I found a possible solution, i might use the free gpt for the flow dev of the idea development and when i get to these moments where gpt starts getting maxed out/giving false details i can package it up and bring it to grok for execution
You said:
Yes lets try the first handoff
You said:
Json
You said:
Yes phase 2
You said:
After test it seems this is going to be a good path forward
You said:
Also, let me know ahead of time if i am reaching a point where i should either move reliance to grok or get information that may help advance discussion here
You said:
This is what grok and i are looking at so far. Any feedback? {

Is the September efforts realistic with my reduced hours?
You said:
Update phasing the Wellness Tracker rollout (starting with EDC theme basics like habit logs for 3 core habits: gear maintenance, daily rucking, preparedness checklists) and delaying full fitness app integration until post-Oct 15, 2025, launch effectively mitigates scope creep. This keeps focus on Personal Shopper MVP while reusing quiz/UI for EDC features.
Updated Plan:
•  Phase 1 (Aug–Oct 2025): Launch Personal Shopper with EDC-themed wellness previews (e.g., loyalty-linked habit nudges), reusable for Healthcare.
•  Phase 2 (Nov 2025): Expand Wellness Tracker with phased features (e.g., EDC tracking), integrate fitness app elements (e.g., Body Fat % Tracker metrics) for combined app.

For Business Plan Refinement: “Act as a business consultant. Refine my business plan for a rugged Americana personal shopper app with affiliate-first monetization transitioning to dropshipping. Include revenue targets of $3K–$5K/month by Nov 2025, $200K/year by July 2026, and reusability for wellness and healthcare ventures. Provide a SWOT analysis

Research and identify other companies that align with my goals and objectives that might be worth approaching especially if i can use them to create my own items to sell and dropship

These dont work until i am not relying on the affiliate. I need to keep these for that transition but need alternatives while i cant tell if they purchase or not

Add strauss america as potential affiliate/partner
You said:
Research
You said:
Ok, so for setting up this business is legal zoom a good option or should i look for a local lawyer
You said:
Draft checklist for legalzoom
You said:
Yes, pdf
You said:
I got a snippet, all good
You said:
Add this company as potential affiliate/partner https://www.bespokepost.com/store/mini_pdp/fieldworth-loom-wash-jersey-tee-set-of-3/fieldworth
You said:
Add anything from the legalzoom checklist to bite sized task that can be if there are any
You said:
I dont think these count as bite sized in the sense that i can just complete, review in my phone. Even though these are short duration they would still require me to be at my computer and research and not just respond/approve. Any of these type can be still considered deep work but maybe bundled together if they are short duration and can flow from one to the next maybe any of these can be referred to as deep work bundles
You said:
With this new approach how many deep work bundles do i have and how many true deep work tasks
You said:
I think as the list is short it is fine but add that going forward
You said:
Not at the moment
You said:
Yes, and what is the remaining bite sized for the app suite
You said:
Let’s do 3, can i reference the logo from the other chat? Should i copy and paste it here?
You said:
You said:
Yes
You said:
Can i get a sample of each loyalty badge draft
You said:
?
You said:
It says it expired already
You said:
Is there a system issue?
You said:
Try one at a time
You said:
Generate draft of loyalty badge

Ember: Flame icon in the center
You said:
Should i try back later?
You said:
Truth check
You said:
Just retry ember and log this in the trust break log
You said:
There is nothing there
You said:
Pdf is fine
You said:
One at a time, easier to be clear on feedback
You said:
None of those can be considered true, i wont have enough people as customers to back up any of those statements
You said:
Confirmed for now
You said:
Can gpt do research to see if an email questionnaire asking feedback regarding if people made purchases, what they did or did not like about the experience going through the affiliate link, if they would recommend, do it again etc are at all successful 
You said:
Draft the email
You said:
Save these for approval in another bite sized session
You said:
Give me a prompt for grok to see if it can generate a draft of the ember shield
You said:
Not yet, let me test this one first
You said:
Its not working, the results are not getting near what i am looking for. The specificity it is asking for is too great 
You said:
It was asking for a reference artist/logo to look at. Is there one to use that would align with the intent here?
You said:
Didn’t work
You said:
Neither
You said:
Gpt can try again
You said:
Gpt cant do images today?
You said:
Flag it but i think i am done for the day
You said:
Sure, i think that is a good idea going forward. What can be a short key phrase to initiate this
You said:
How would gpt know it is the end of a session if i didnt state it
You said:
Yes
You said:
I think it would be good to keep a list of these key phrases and the actions they initiate. This will help me remember and when i het the google sheets up and running it can be added there
You said:
Arent there a lot more so far?
You said:
Shouldnt deep work, deep work bundle, check in, weekly check in, use day wrap not wrap it up
You said:
Day wrap
You said:
Research the business ideas again again the market to check for any changes in viability and ROI to make sure i am spending my energy and money in the right direction, i would rather know sooner than later if i should make a change.
You said:
Yes, add a go/no-go to the weekly check in 
You said:
Truth check
You said:
Truth check against this

If you’d like, I can set a weekly in‑chat reminder for the Weekly Check In + Go/No‑Go (e.g., Mondays at 9am). Just say the day/time and I’ll schedule it.


You cant schedule anything unless there was an uodate?
You said:
Log it
You said:
Also, why did the analysis change so drastically on the businesses regarding viability and ROI potential from the other week?
You said:
No, i am curious if there are other markets similar that if combined would make the healthcare more appealing viable. Are Dentist, mental health, etc already in the evaluation?
You said:
Research
You said:
Yes
You said:
Save these for bite sized tasks
You said:
Does this new information change the status of this business rating in the plan?
You said:
Not yet, i want to figure out if the other low ratings can be improved to reach green and keep the plan on track or if they are just weaker. 

The body fat % is officially a future add on to the EDC/wellness app
You said:
Add this path to green evaluation to the go/no-go effort as it will give a clear this is permanent no-go or temporary and if i feel like allocating more time or asking for help i can get it to green
You said:
Yes
You said:
Yes, i would like to see it
You said:
Yes, it will be extremely helpful especially as i think of my ideas and need to order them. Can gpt add a color circle of the color that is being chosen? It will help it stand out as i am looking through the read out
You said:
Yes
You said:
Yes
You said:
Not yet, are there any other businesses that i had that are not being discussed? Or did i combine some and that is why it seems like less
You said:
No that is fine, i do think the lifestyle hub should still stay on the list so it stays on my radar but flag as 
no current action items
You said:
Yes, show it as deferred also add details of what is merged so i can see clearly where everything went.

Also, the daily prompt, journaling, daily connection should also show as part of the EDC/Wellness

Add the bible app and link up game as deferred too

Going forward everything stays on the list a rated accordingly. If something is deemed a Permanent no-go it should get a black circle but stay on the list at the bottom. This will help in case i think of the idea again or want to revisit based on new info
You said:
Yes, let me see current dashboard
You said:
This is fine for now, maybe next iteration
You said:
Yea
You said:
I will wait

How much room is left in this thread? I dont want to reach the limit without having the ability to get a quick transfer message from a thread

Which is better for gpt continuity, summarize and compress or quick transfer template
You said:
Yes
You said:
