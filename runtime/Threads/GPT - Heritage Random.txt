Approve integration no json needed at this time
You said:
What’s my total presale hours input
You said:
My hours went down drastically, i thought with all the additions i would be much higher
You said:
What do the deferred features bring to the valuation for the 50+ extra hours
You said:
Can i have something other than esg tracker? What is something just as qualifying but not idealogical 
You said:
Let’s do all 4, since the reduction of my time input, i have room. Unless there are higher value added items i needed to attend to
You said:
Yes
You said:
So where does my current net valuation potential sit
You said:
And so far no other major features are missing that would make the company look foolish or behind
You said:
Why is this deferred? How much of my time would it be?

Voice / Vision / UX Frontier

You said:
Lets try for it but it will still be lower priority 
You said:
So this puts me at about 45m net?
You said:
So if 45m is the net, what is the gross sale price
You said:
Sounds good, i will still want to talk in net until the bidding starts as i will want to know what number i am putting out there 
You said:
It has come a long way from the 8-10m not that long ago
You said:
Ok, as an advisor, is there anything i am overlooking when thinking of my readiness to start the deep work? Regarding structure, focus, features that customers want i may be missing, where the trend is headed, etc

Basically, i have time until my computer gets here so evaluating and strengthening this on my phone is what i have this week
You said:
Thoughts on this?

Larry Ellison $ORCL stressed that AI models perform at their best when trained on privately owned data—not just the public web data used by GPT, Grok, Llama, and others.

That’s why companies like $HIMS, $DUOL, $LMND are set to win.

Proprietary data is the real competitive edge.

ChatGPT can’t match that
You said:
Isn’t this kind of the plan to create my own version of notebook llm or is that different
You said:
And when it is ready this would be worth a lot too Heritage Intelligence Layer,
You said:
Sounds good
You said:
Ok since pre sale seems relatively tight let’s focus a bit post sale. Regarding the mobility fleet…is Tesla renting their vehicles and robots? Is this going to ruin opportunities like mobility fleet?
You said:
I still think i would like to have the chauffeur angle where the taxi and Optimus are a package. They go with the elderly to help shop go to the doctor, the disabled veteran, women roommates that just want to be safe, people going out on the town that want to feel safe, etc
You said:
Does this change the roi net projections mentioned earlier
You said:
Let us think of a better name than this for the service, i don’t want it to feel like an old folks joke with assisted living 
You said:
I feel like guardian goes in the militant vein i am trying to stay away from. Does something like concierge make sense 
You said:
I am still not seeing it… lets see a name that fits heritage, concierge, tour guide, security without feeling gov or militant, assistance without making people feel helpless, we are along for their journey and just trying to alleviate their extra burdens so they can be in the moment and focus on living and enjoyment getting the things they need, getting to their appointment on time without the added stress etc  
You said:
What are some more in this vein Hearthbound Concierge
You said:
What about Heritage Lux
You said:
Which would test better between these.

Heritage Concierge

Heritage Concierge Lux

Hearthbound Concierge

Hearthbound Concierge Lux

Or maybe the name is whiynout Lux and “The Lux” is an upgraded version for those extra special occasions
You said:
Approved
You said:
How does this clarification and naming, where the company fits with teslas plans etc impact the potential net revenue
You said:
How much is the brand worth itself?

What if there is a line specifically for elderly homes, special needs, etc and maybe government would help make it cheaper for them?
You said:
Are there any post sale businesses that are yet to be clearly defined
You said:
Lets start with heritage press, as my advisor give me a recommendation with pros and cons roi etc.

Then we can move down the list in priority of potential and follow the same format
You said:
Oops, just realized i accidentally brought heritage master items here. Is there an issue with any info missing? Do i need a json to bring info back to the master? Bring a json here and make this the master? No issue and everything is still known by got between threads

ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.
