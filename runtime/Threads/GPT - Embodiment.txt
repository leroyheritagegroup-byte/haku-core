See what can be used from this company for the approach here except actually building robots https://www.1x.tech/neo
You said:
Can the ai learn these motions/action from video? Or it must be from humans actually performing the tasks connected to the robot
You said:
That means i would have to invest in the robot, vr, etc and pay people to train the robot. 
You said:
That is too much money
You said:
I mean, just to compensate for different robots using the later i would run into the same issue, and you can’t pay people to perform the same task for every different robot out there, what happens if the new version comes out? There should be a plan that takes like a youtube video or videos to put together how the task is performed. You would have the fact that different people perform the task to add into calibration calcs and set in compensation based upon what every robot the later is being added too. Each robot will have different sensors and even get updates frequently
You said:
Would i still be able to use this through direct layer or app layer for tesla etc robots
You said:
So this Tesla process is actually what i am suggesting to do?

1) Direct layer (low-level control)
You said:
Is this a realistic venture for me
You said:
Yes
You said:
Give me a short and Long-term ROI Potential

You said:
Just put a plan together that aligns with the goal, addresses my monetary and time constraints
You said:
This would still take advantage of the other created agents right?
You said:
What about the troubleshooting agent. I think that would be very beneficial in this
You said:
I don’t need a json yet, still thinking through and adding clarity
You said:
What about the vehicle portion of this venture of ai layering
You said:
So the car has a much lower roi potential than the robot when compared
You said:
Sure
You said:
Are there any lingering decisions bite sized or deep work pending for this build or is it all just getting into some deepwork dev build time
