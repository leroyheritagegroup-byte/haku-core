 ## Personal Writing & Editorial Protocol (ArtOps Internal Rule)
**Status:** Approved
**Summary:** Maintain authorship integrity across all personal and brand writing by using AI as an editorial support tool.

**Details:**
- **AI’s role:** Strictly *editorial support* — grammar, structure, clarity, fact-checking, citation assistance, and plagiarism screening.
- **Human authorship:** All creative writing remains user-written; AI cannot originate or expand creative sections beyond editorial aid.
- **Compliance:** All text must pass an internal **Attribution Check**, use the system's reference protocol for sources/inspirations, and have every AI edit logged under Controlled Collaboration for authorship proof.
- **Agents responsible:** `!content` (edit/review), `!security` (authorship log), `!finops` (copyright ROI tracking if monetized).

## ArtOps Revenue Model
**Status:** Discussed
**Summary:** A hybrid model — percentage-based revenue share for placements **plus** tiered subscriptions for recurring creative/editorial support — produces the strongest net margin and stability for ArtOps.

**Details:**
- **Commission-only (rev-share):** Scales fast if artists succeed, but cash flow is irregular with heavy admin and a risk of disputes over credits/payouts. Typical Margin: 15–30% of project gross, but inconsistent.
- **Subscription-only (tiers):** Predictable MRR, easy automation, and simple ROI tracking, but slower to onboard high-talent creators and harder to scale prestige placements. Typical Gross Margin: 60–75% after onboarding.
- **Hybrid (recommended):** Combines the benefits of both models for a stronger net margin and stability.

 ## **ArtOps Hybrid Model (subscription + commission)**
**Status:** Approved
**Summary:** A hybrid monetization model that combines a predictable base income from subscriptions with upside from placements, allowing high performers to upgrade tiers while maintaining a slightly more complex operational structure. The blended margin after 3-6 months of maturity is estimated at 70–80%.

**Details:**

Technical Architecture:
- Subscription Tiers: Free, Basic, Premium, and Elite
- Placements: Artwork sales, sponsored posts, collaborations, etc.
- Onboarding Template Packs: For potential partners to resell ArtOps as "Powered-by-Leroy" hubs
- Directory + Template Packs: For onboarding new studios, clinics, or creators under white-label licenses

Monetization Structure:
- Subscription Fees: Free, $9/mo (Basic), $25/mo (Premium), and $50/mo (Elite)
- Placement Revenue Share: 80% to ArtOps, 20% to partners
- White-label Licensing: Offers small studios, clinics, or creators the ability to run mini-HeritageOps instances under license

**Impact:** Adding more licensees or scaling the model can bridge the remaining ~$400 K gap to $2 M net.
