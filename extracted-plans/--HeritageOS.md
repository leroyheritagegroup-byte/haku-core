## Status: approved/locked/current/proposed

The project is currently locked and part of the approved "Heritage Master 6" with a version number of "2025-10-30-v1.0".

## Summary:

HeritageOS is a comprehensive digital platform that includes various revenue streams, live builds, and improvement notes. It focuses on carrying forward all work, approvals, and improvement notes with streamlined execution and a return on investment (ROI) focus. The project preserves the ArtOps Creative Branch, which provides scalable creative output as monetizable micro-services and internal production support for all Heritage ventures.

## Details:

The details of the HeritageOS project are organized into clear sections below:

### Meta Data
- Title: "Heritage Master 6"
- Version number: "2025-10-30-v1.0"
- Project status: Locked and approved

### Core Definition
- Purpose: Provide scalable creative output (music, photo, video, copy) as monetizable micro-services and as internal production support for all Heritage ventures.
- Status: Paused → Pilot (reinstated for 2025-Q4 testing).
- Positioning: Bridges *creative economy + AI automation*; uses existing agents and workflows rather than new hires.

### Sub-Streams (Confirmed Intact)
1. **Creative Placement Agent** – Automates music, photo, and video placement across partner networks (sync, ad, and short-form media).
2. **Editing/Retouch Micro-Services** – Paid on-demand creative fixes (photo cleanup, reels editing, short-form ad polish).
3. **ArtOps Directory** – A curated network of vetted creators available for controlled collaboration or white-label work.
4. **Creative Workflow Template Packs** – Sellable Notion/Sheets/Premiere packs for creators; also bundled with HeritageOS Licensing.
5. **Internal Production Hub** – In-house creative studio serving *Stillhouse* (reels, journaling content), *Healthcare* (flyers, explainer videos), and *HeritageOS* (training visuals).

### Revenue & ROI Model
- **Direct:**
  - Paid micro-service jobs (editing, templates, sync placement).
  - Directory subscription or referral fees.
- **Indirect:**
  - Boosted conversions via high-quality creative in Healthcare pilots and Stillhouse campaigns.
  - Bundled upsells in HeritageOS Licensing (ArtOps template packs, creative support tier).

### Integration Hooks
- Agents involved: `!content`, `!growth`, `!mo`, `!finops`
- Cross-system use:
  - Print-on-Demand pipeline (Stillhouse journals)
  - Flyer/Video kits (Healthcare outreach)
  - Marketing visuals & storyboards (Leroy Heritage App / Brand)
- Controlled Collaboration compliance: All creative output tagged, logged, and revocable.

### Next Step Options
1. Reactivate pilot micro-service (photo/video retouch) to validate pricing and turnaround workflow.
2. Connect ArtOps to the Healthcare flyer/video kits (scheduled for Nov 15).
3. Prepare ROI tracking template to isolate ArtOps’ contribution to cross-stream revenue.

### Policy
- AI's role: strictly *editorial support* - grammar, structure, clarity, fact-checking, citation assistance, and plagiarism screening.
- Human authorship: all creative writing, essays, stories, scripts, or lyrics remain user-written; AI cannot originate or expand creative sections beyond editorial aid.
- Compliance:
  - All text must pass internal **Attribution Check** (for accidental reuse or unattributed phrasing).
  - **Reference protocol:** when sources or inspirations are used, AI flags and formats citations in your preferred reference style.
  - **Audit trail:** every AI edit is logged under Controlled Collaboration for authorship proof.
- Agents responsible: `!content` (edit/review), `!security` (authorship log), `!finops` (copyright ROI tracking if monetized).

### Integration Points
- Applies to **ArtOps Creative Branch**, **Healthcare content**, **Stillhouse journaling**, and **any marketing copy** tied to your name or brand voice.
  - The system differentiates **authored** vs **AI-assisted** text for transparent reporting and credit allocation.
