### Revenue & ROI Model

- Direct: paid micro-service jobs, directory subscription or referral fees
- Indirect: boosted conversions via high-quality creative in Healthcare pilots and Stillhouse campaigns, bundled upsells in HeritageOps licensing (ArtOps template packs, creative support tier)

### Integration Hooks

- AI’s role: editorial support - grammar, structure, clarity, fact-checking, citation assistance, and plagiarism screening
- Human authorship: all creative writing, essays, stories, scripts, or lyrics remain user-written
- Compliance: internal Attribution Check, reference protocol, audit trail

### Next Steps

1. Reactivate pilot micro-service (photo/video retouch) to validate pricing and turnaround workflow.
2. Connect ArtOps to the Healthcare flyer/video kits (scheduled for Nov 15).
3. Prepare ROI tracking template to isolate ArtOps’ contribution to cross-stream revenue.
