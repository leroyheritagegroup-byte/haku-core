 Title: Heritage Master 6
Version: 2025-10-30-v1.0
Created_at_ET: 2025-10-30
Parent_threads: ["Heritage Master 5"]
Purpose: Carry forward all work, approvals, and improvement notes with streamlined execution and ROI focus.

Status: Current/Active

Summary:
The MakerOps initiative, Heritage Master 6, focuses on carrying forward all work from the previous version with a focus on realism, ROI, and security. The ArtOps Creative Branch is reinstated as both a direct revenue stream and cross-stream support layer for Healthcare, Stillhouse, and HeritageOps Licensing.

Details:

**MakerOps Carry Over Integrity:**
- All seven revenue streams carried (with active/paused/deferred tags).
- Live build tracks: Stillhouse MVP → Nov 15, Healthcare Pilot → Nov 15, HeritageOps Docs → Nov 5.
- ROI uplift: +$100–200K gross vs Master 5 through ArtOps and Stillhouse tiers.
- Zero-Trust and least-privilege model locked; agents !core !growth !mo !finops !security !build remain leads.
- Improvement notes embedded for concise, ego-free, summary-first format.

**ArtOps Creative Branch:**
- Purpose: Provide scalable creative output (music, photo, video, copy) as monetizable micro-services and internal production support for all Heritage ventures.
- Status: Paused → Pilot (reinstated for 2025-Q4 testing).
- Positioning: Bridges creative economy + AI automation; uses existing agents and workflows rather than new hires.

**Sub-Streams (Confirmed Intact):**
1. Creative Placement Agent – Automates music, photo, and video placement across partner networks (sync, ad, and short-form media).
2. Editing/Retouch Micro-Services – Paid on-demand creative fixes (photo cleanup, reels editing, short-form ad polish).
3. ArtOps Directory – A curated network of vetted creators available for controlled collaboration or white-label work.
4. Creative Workflow Template Packs – Sellable Notion/Sheets/Premiere packs for creators; also bundled with HeritageOps Licensing.
5. Internal Production Hub – In-house creative studio serving Stillhouse (reels, journaling content), Healthcare (flyers, explainer videos), and HeritageOps (training visuals).

**Revenue & ROI Model:**
- Direct:
  - Paid micro-service jobs (editing, templates, sync placement).
  - Directory subscription or referral fees.
- Indirect:
  - Boosted conversions via high-quality creative in Healthcare pilots and Stillhouse campaigns.
  - Bundled upsells in HeritageOps licensing (ArtOps template packs, creative support tier).

**Integration Hooks:**
- Agents involved: `!content`, `!growth`, `!mo`, `!finops`
- Cross-system use:
  - Print-on-Demand pipeline (Stillhouse journals)
  - Flyer/Video kits (Healthcare outreach)
  - Marketing visuals & storyboards (Leroy Heritage App / Brand)
- Controlled Collaboration compliance: All creative output tagged, logged, and revocable.

**Next Step Options:**
1. Reactivate pilot micro-service (photo/video retouch) to validate pricing and turnaround workflow.
2. Connect ArtOps to the Healthcare flyer/video kits (scheduled for Nov 15).
3. Prepare ROI tracking template to isolate ArtOps’ contribution to cross-stream revenue.

**Verdict:** Green – Fully preserved and strengthened. No capabilities, roles, or monetization paths dropped since Master 5 — it’s more structured and revenue-tied than before.
