## Summary
Hearthline is a comprehensive plan that carries forward all work, approvals, and improvement notes from Heritage Master 5 with streamlined execution and ROI focus. It includes seven revenue streams, live build tracks, and ROI uplift compared to Master 5. A Zero-Trust and least-privilege model is locked, and agents remain as leads.

## Details

### Core Definition
**Purpose:** Provide scalable creative output (music, photo, video, copy) as monetizable micro-services **and** as internal production support for all Heritage ventures.
**Status:** Paused → Pilot (reinstated for 2025-Q4 testing).
**Positioning:** Bridges *creative economy + AI automation*; uses existing agents and workflows rather than new hires.

### Sub-Streams (Confirmed Intact)
1. **Creative Placement Agent** – Automates music, photo, and video placement across partner networks (sync, ad, and short-form media).
2. **Editing/Retouch Micro-Services** – Paid on-demand creative fixes (photo cleanup, reels editing, short-form ad polish).
3. **ArtOps Directory** – A curated network of vetted creators available for controlled collaboration or white-label work.
4. **Creative Workflow Template Packs** – Sellable Notion/Sheets/Premiere packs for creators; also bundled with HeritageOps Licensing.
5. **Internal Production Hub** – In-house creative studio serving *Stillhouse* (reels, journaling content), *Healthcare* (flyers, explainer videos), and *HeritageOps* (training visuals).

### Revenue & ROI Model
- **Direct:**
  - Paid micro-service jobs (editing, templates, sync placement).
  - Directory subscription or referral fees.
- **Indirect:**
  - Boosted conversions via high-quality creative in Healthcare pilots and Stillhouse campaigns.
  - Bundled upsells in HeritageOps licensing (ArtOps template packs, creative support tier).

### Integration Hooks
- **Agents involved:** `!content`, `!growth`, `!mo`, `!finops`
- **Cross-system use:**
  - Print-on-Demand pipeline (Stillhouse journals)
  - Flyer/Video kits (Healthcare outreach)
  - Marketing visuals & storyboards (Leroy Heritage App / Brand)
- **Controlled Collaboration compliance:** All creative output tagged, logged, and revocable.

### Next Step Options
1. Reactivate pilot micro-service (photo/video retouch) to validate pricing and turnaround workflow.
2. Connect ArtOps to the Healthcare flyer/video kits (scheduled for Nov 15).
3. Prepare ROI tracking template to isolate ArtOps’ contribution to cross-stream revenue.

**Verdict:** 🟢 Fully preserved and strengthened. No capabilities, roles, or monetization paths dropped since Master 5 — it’s more structured and revenue-tied than before.
