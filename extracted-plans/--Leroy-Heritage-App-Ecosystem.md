 # Leroy Heritage App Ecosystem

## Status: Active under Controlled Collaboration

### Summary:
Heritage Master 6 is live and correctly structured, preserving all previously approved revenue streams while tightening ROI focus, security, and ArtOps reintegration. The ArtOps Creative Branch retains every previously approved role, function, and revenue path, now structured as both a direct revenue stream and a cross-stream support layer for Healthcare, Stillhouse, and HeritageOps Licensing.

### Details:

#### Core Definition:
- Purpose: Provide scalable creative output (music, photo, video, copy) as monetizable micro-services and internal production support for all Heritage ventures.
- Status: Paused → Pilot (reinstated for 2025-Q4 testing).
- Positioning: Bridges *creative economy + AI automation*; uses existing agents and workflows rather than new hires.

#### Sub-Streams:
1. Creative Placement Agent: Automates music, photo, and video placement across partner networks (sync, ad, and short-form media).
2. Editing/Retouch Micro-Services: Paid on-demand creative fixes (photo cleanup, reels editing, short-form ad polish).
3. ArtOps Directory: A curated network of vetted creators available for controlled collaboration or white-label work.
4. Creative Workflow Template Packs: Sellable Notion/Sheets/Premiere packs for creators; also bundled with HeritageOps Licensing.
5. Internal Production Hub: In-house creative studio serving Stillhouse (reels, journaling content), Healthcare (flyers, explainer videos), and HeritageOps (training visuals).

#### Revenue & ROI Model:
- Direct: Paid micro-service jobs (editing, templates, sync placement). Directory subscription or referral fees.
- Indirect: Boosted conversions via high-quality creative in Healthcare pilots and Stillhouse campaigns. Bundled upsells in HeritageOps licensing (ArtOps template packs, creative support tier).

#### Integration Hooks:
- Agents involved: `!content`, `!growth`, `!mo`, `!finops`
- Cross-system use: Print-on-Demand pipeline (Stillhouse journals), Flyer/Video kits (Healthcare outreach), Marketing visuals & storyboards (Leroy Heritage App / Brand).
- Controlled Collaboration compliance: All creative output tagged, logged, and revocable.

#### Next Step Options:
1. Reactivate pilot micro-service (photo/video retouch) to validate pricing and turnaround workflow.
2. Connect ArtOps to the Healthcare flyer/video kits (scheduled for Nov 15).
3. Prepare ROI tracking template to isolate ArtOps’ contribution to cross-stream revenue.
